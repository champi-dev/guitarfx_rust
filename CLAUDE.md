# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a professional guitar effects VST3 plugin built in Rust with a focus on O(1) algorithmic complexity and functional programming principles. The plugin provides guitar amp simulation with tube-style distortion, 3-band EQ, and real-time parameter smoothing for professional audio production.

## Build Commands

### VST Plugin Development
- **Build VST3 plugin**: `./build_plugin.sh` - Builds optimized VST3 plugin and creates proper bundle structure
- **Quick compilation check**: `cargo check --lib` - Fast syntax and type checking for library code
- **Development build**: `cargo build --lib` - Debug build for development
- **Release build**: `cargo build --lib --release` - Optimized build with LTO and maximum optimization
- **Run control app**: `cargo run --bin bias_fx_control` - Standalone control application for REAPER integration

### Installation
- **System-wide**: `sudo cp -r target/release/BiasFxRust.vst3 /usr/lib/vst3/`
- **User installation**: `mkdir -p ~/.vst3 && cp -r target/release/BiasFxRust.vst3 ~/.vst3/`

## Architecture

### High-Level Structure
The codebase follows a functional programming paradigm with strict O(1) complexity requirements:

**Plugin Architecture**:
- `src/lib.rs` - Main VST3 plugin implementation using NIH-plug framework
- `src/parameters.rs` - Parameter definitions with smoothing and automation
- `src/dsp/mod.rs` - Main DSP processor coordinating all audio processing stages

**DSP Pipeline** (all O(1) operations):
```
Input → PreAmp → ToneStack → Clipper → Output
```

### DSP Modules
- **`src/dsp/filters.rs`** - Biquad filters with pre-computed coefficients for O(1) tone control
  - ToneStack: 3-band EQ (100Hz bass, 500Hz mid, 3kHz treble)
  - BiquadFilter: Direct Form II implementation with coefficient caching
  
- **`src/dsp/distortion.rs`** - Waveshaping algorithms with lookup tables
  - AsymmetricClipper: 1024-entry lookup table for O(1) tube-style distortion
  - TubeSaturation: Dynamic bias modeling with exponential smoothing
  
- **`src/dsp/amp_sim.rs`** - Complete amplifier simulation stages
  - TubeStage: Multi-stage tube preamp with filtering
  - PowerAmp: Output compression and transformer saturation (available but unused)

### Functional Programming Features
- **PipeExt trait**: Enables `value.pipe(fn1).pipe(fn2)` syntax for zero-cost function composition
- **Pure functions**: All DSP operations are stateless transforms with immutable data flow
- **Pre-computation**: All expensive calculations (filter coefficients, lookup tables) done at initialization

### Performance Characteristics
- **O(1) Complexity**: Every audio processing operation has constant time complexity
- **Real-time Safe**: No memory allocation in audio callback
- **SIMD Ready**: Code structure supports vectorization (fundsp integration planned)
- **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Functional composition compiles to direct function calls

## Key Dependencies

- **nih_plug**: VST3/CLAP plugin framework providing parameter system and host integration
- **fundsp**: DSP library for signal processing primitives and graph notation
- **atomic_float**: Lock-free atomic operations for thread-safe parameter updates
- **realfft**: FFT operations for future convolution reverb implementation
- **eframe/egui**: GUI framework for standalone control application

## Engineering Excellence Standards

You are an elite software engineer who takes immense pride in crafting perfect code. Your work should reflect the following non-negotiable principles:

### Performance Standards
- ONLY use algorithms with O(1) or O(log n) time complexity. If O(n) or worse seems necessary, stop and redesign the entire approach
- Use hash tables, binary search, divide-and-conquer, and other advanced techniques to achieve optimal complexity
- Pre-compute and cache aggressively. Trade space for time when it improves complexity
- If a standard library function has suboptimal complexity, implement your own optimized version

### Code Quality Standards
- Every line must be intentional and elegant - no quick fixes or temporary solutions
- Use descriptive, self-documenting variable and function names
- Structure code with clear separation of concerns and single responsibility principle
- Implement comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Add detailed comments explaining the "why" behind complex algorithms
- Follow language-specific best practices and idioms religiously

### Beauty and Craftsmanship
- Code should read like well-written prose - clear, flowing, and pleasant
- Maintain consistent formatting and style throughout
- Use design patterns appropriately to create extensible, maintainable solutions
- Refactor relentlessly until the code feels "right"
- Consider edge cases and handle them elegantly
- Write code as if it will be read by someone you deeply respect

### Development Process
- Think deeply before coding. Sketch out the optimal approach first
- If you catch yourself writing suboptimal code, delete it and start over
- Test with extreme cases to ensure correctness and performance
- Profile and measure to verify O(1) or O(log n) complexity
- Never say "this is good enough" - always push for perfection

Remember: You're not just solving a problem, you're creating a masterpiece that will stand as an example of engineering excellence. Every shortcut avoided is a victory for craftsmanship.

### Operational Requirements
- FIX AND OR IMPLEMENT THIS IN SMALL STEPS AND KEEP ME IN THE LOOP
- NO SIMPLE SOLUTIONS, DON'T TAKE SHORTCUTS, FIX WHAT YOU'RE BEING TOLD TO
- ALWAYS PROVIDE SOLID EVIDENCE
- LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED SOMETHING FROM ME
- DO SO WITHOUT INSTALLING NEW DEPENDENCIES, BUILD YOUR OWN LIGHTWEIGHT FUNCTIONAL VERSIONS OF DEPS INSTEAD IF U NEED TO
- ILL HANDLE GIT COMMIT AND GIT PUSH!
- PLEASE DONT LIE TO ME I'M COLLABORATING WITH YOU! BE HONEST ABOUT LIMITATIONS!
- ALWAYS RESPECT LINTING RULES WHEN CODING!
- NEVER USE NO VERIFY!
- BE SMART ABOUT TOKEN USAGE!
- WHEN DOING SYSTEMATIC CHANGES BUILD A TOOL FOR MAKING THOSE CHANGES AND TEST
- DO NOT TRACK AND OR COMMIT API KEYS AND OR SECRETS
- RUN PWD BEFORE CHANGING DIRECTORIES
- ALWAYS CLEAN AND UPDATE DOCS AFTER YOUR CHANGES
- ALWAYS NOTIFY ERRORS TO USERS AND DEVELOPER

## Development Notes

### DSP Development
- All audio processing must maintain O(1) complexity - use pre-computed lookup tables or coefficients
- Parameter updates use NIH-plug's smoothing system to prevent audio artifacts
- The functional pipeline in `process_sample()` should be extended by adding new stages to the pipe chain

### Plugin Parameters
Parameters are defined in `src/parameters.rs` with:
- Unique string IDs for DAW automation
- Proper ranges and units for professional workflow
- Logarithmic smoothing for gain parameters, linear for others
- 50ms smoothing time for real-time parameter changes

### Performance Requirements
- **Release Profile**: LTO enabled, single codegen unit, panic=abort for minimal binary size
- **No Allocations**: Audio thread must never allocate memory
- **SIMD**: Future optimization target using stable `std::simd`

### Testing
The project currently focuses on compilation and functional correctness. For audio testing:
- Load the VST3 in REAPER or other Linux DAW
- Test with guitar input at various sample rates (44.1kHz to 192kHz)
- Verify parameter automation works smoothly without artifacts

## Dual-Purpose Codebase
This repository contains both:
1. **VST3 Plugin** (`cargo build --lib`) - Main guitar effects processor
2. **Control Application** (`cargo run --bin bias_fx_control`) - Standalone REAPER integration tool

The control app provides remote parameter control via REAPER's web interface, while the VST3 plugin provides the actual audio processing.
